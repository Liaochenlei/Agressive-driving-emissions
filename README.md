This repository contains the main codes and functions for the paper entitled “Trends towards more aggressive driving will hinder future transport emissions reductions in China”.
Car driving is indubitable to be one of the major emission contributors that closely related to everyone's daily life. Despite various studies have focused on the vehicle emission reduction challenges, it is still unclear what can be done to reduce vehicle emissions from the common driver's side. Therefore, in this study, we focused on decomposing vehicle emissions from the daily driving behavior perspective, and gained insights into how overlooked the simple car-following maneuver alone could affect national vehicle emissions to a large extent. 
We used four large naturalistic driving trajectory datasets and proposed a simple yet effective Standardized Driver Aggressiveness Index (SDAI) based on traffic hysteresis theory to estimate the standardized driving behavior-induced emission and its evolvement. Our findings underline the urgent need for immediate efforts to lead drivers into adopting better driving behaviors in China, whilst provide meaningful research implications to other developing countries like India, Brazil, South Africa, etc., on advocating reducing vehicle emissions from the driver's side.
